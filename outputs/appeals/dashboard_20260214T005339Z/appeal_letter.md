Re: Appeal of denial for CPT 72148 (Lumbar MRI) — Request for reconsideration of medical necessity determination

Dear Appeals Reviewer,

We respectfully request reversal of the denial dated for CPT 72148. The treating provider ordered a lumbar MRI after the patient experienced 14 weeks of persistent low back pain with radicular symptoms, objective neurologic findings on exam (reduced sensation in the L5 distribution and a positive straight-leg raise), and completion of six weeks of supervised physical therapy without meaningful improvement. The charted history also documents trials of NSAIDs and neuropathic pain medication without restoration of function. Given persistent radicular symptoms, objective neurologic findings, and failed appropriate conservative care, the lumbar MRI is necessary to evaluate for compressive pathology and to inform treatment planning.

Please find the detailed clinical justification and supporting evidence attached for your review. We request prompt reconsideration within the plan’s appeal timeframe.

Sincerely,
Appeals Team

## Detailed Justification

Summary of clinical facts (from chart notes):
- Duration and symptoms: Patient has chronic low back pain with radicular symptoms for 14 weeks.
  Citation: case chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).
- Conservative therapy: Completed six weeks of supervised physical therapy with no meaningful improvement; trialed NSAIDs and neuropathic pain medication with persistent functional limitation.
  Citation: case chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).
- Objective findings: Neurologic exam documents reduced sensation in L5 distribution and a positive straight-leg raise.
  Citation: case chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).
- Provider recommendation: Treating clinician recommends lumbar MRI to evaluate persistent symptoms and guide treatment planning.
  Citation: case chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).

Why MRI is medically necessary in this context:
1) The patient has persistent radicular symptoms beyond a standard conservative management period (14 weeks total symptom duration with six weeks of supervised PT that failed to produce meaningful improvement). This exceeds the usual 6–8 weeks conservative management interval referenced in relevant external appeal decisions addressing back pain imaging determinations. Given ongoing radicular symptoms and failed conservative care, advanced imaging is indicated to evaluate for potentially surgically or procedurally remediable pathology.
  Citation: external appeal case summarizing standard of care of six to eight weeks of conservative management before imaging (201907-119685).

2) There are objective neurologic findings (reduced sensation in the L5 distribution and a positive straight-leg raise) documented on exam. The presence of focal neurologic signs and persistent radicular symptoms supports neuroimaging to identify compressive lesions (e.g., disc herniation, significant foraminal/central stenosis) that would alter management.
  Citation: chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).

3) The treating provider’s recommendation for MRI is consistent with evaluation needed to inform further interventions after failed conservative therapy and persistent objective deficits. Denial for lack of documentation of medical necessity does not align with the record documenting failed conservative care, objective neurologic findings, and the clinician’s contemporaneous imaging recommendation.
  Citation: chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).

Requested action:
- Reverse the medical necessity denial for CPT 72148 and authorize the lumbar MRI to appropriately evaluate for compressive pathology and to guide next-step care.
