# Appeal Letter Draft

To: UnitedHealthcare Appeals Department
Re: Appeal of denial for CPT 72148 — Lumbar spine MRI (with/without contrast)
Patient: (per chart)
Date of Service: (per chart)
Policy/Claim#: (per insurer)

Dear Appeals Reviewer,

We respectfully request reversal of the denial for lumbar MRI (CPT 72148). The treating provider ordered advanced imaging due to persistent radicular low back pain for 14 weeks, failure of an adequate course of conservative therapy (including six weeks of supervised physical therapy and trials of NSAIDs and neuropathic pain medication), ongoing functional limitation, and objective neurologic findings (reduced sensation in the L5 distribution and positive straight-leg raise). The MRI is medically necessary to evaluate the cause of persistent radicular symptoms and to guide timely treatment decisions. Please see the attached detailed justification and supporting documentation. We request expedited reconsideration given the clinical need to determine appropriate next steps in management.

Sincerely,
[ProviderName]
[Facility]


## Detailed Justification

Summary of clinical presentation and reason for imaging request:
- Persistent low back pain with radicular features for 14 weeks despite conservative management (completed six weeks of supervised physical therapy and medication trials), resulting in ongoing functional limitation and need for further diagnostic evaluation. (See citations: case file chart notes excerpt; NY external appeal precedent citing 6–8 weeks conservative management). 

Objective findings supporting need for MRI:
- Neurologic exam documents reduced sensation in the L5 distribution and a positive straight-leg raise, consistent with radicular pathology that warrants advanced imaging after failed conservative care to evaluate for disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or other structural causes. (See citation: case file chart notes excerpt). 

Clinical rationale linking findings to medical necessity:
- Current clinical course: ongoing radicular symptoms for >12 weeks with objective sensory deficit and positive provocative testing, combined with failure of an appropriate trial of conservative therapy, meets accepted criteria for lumbar MRI to identify surgically or procedurally targetable pathology and to inform treatment planning. The insurer’s stated reason for denial — insufficient documentation supporting advanced imaging — is addressed by the treating provider’s progress notes documenting symptom duration, failed conservative therapy, ongoing functional limitation, and focal neurological findings. (See citations: case file chart notes excerpt; NY external appeal precedent noting standard of 6–8 weeks conservative therapy). 

Requested action:
- Reverse the medical necessity denial and authorize the lumbar MRI (CPT 72148) to allow definitive evaluation and timely management of the patient’s persistent radicular low back pain.
