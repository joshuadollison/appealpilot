    "cover_letter": "To: UnitedHealthcare Appeals Department\n\nRe: Appeal of denial for CPT 72148 (Lumbar MRI) \u2014 Request for reconsideration of medical necessity determination\n\nDear Appeals Reviewer,\n\nWe respectfully request reversal of the denial dated for CPT 72148. The treating provider ordered a lumbar MRI after the patient experienced 14 weeks of persistent low back pain with radicular symptoms, objective neurologic findings on exam (reduced sensation in the L5 distribution and a positive straight-leg raise), and completion of six weeks of supervised physical therapy without meaningful improvement. The charted history also documents trials of NSAIDs and neuropathic pain medication without restoration of function. Given persistent radicular symptoms, objective neurologic findings, and failed appropriate conservative care, the lumbar MRI is necessary to evaluate for compressive pathology and to inform treatment planning.\n\nPlease find the detailed clinical justification and supporting evidence attached for your review. We request prompt reconsideration within the plan\u2019s appeal timeframe.\n\nSincerely,\nAppeals Team",

This exceeds the usual 6\u20138 weeks conservative management interval referenced in relevant external appeal decisions addressing back pain imaging determinations. Given ongoing radicular symptoms and failed conservative care, advanced imaging is indicated to evaluate for potentially surgically or procedurally remediable pathology.\n  Citation: external appeal case summarizing standard of care of six to eight weeks of conservative management before imaging (201907-119685).\n\n2) There are objective neurologic findings (reduced sensation in the L5 distribution and a positive straight-leg raise) documented on exam. The presence of focal neurologic signs and persistent radicular symptoms supports neuroimaging to identify compressive lesions (e.g., disc herniation, significant foraminal/central stenosis) that would alter management.\n  Citation: chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).\n\n3) The treating provider\u2019s recommendation for MRI is consistent with evaluation needed to inform further interventions after failed conservative therapy and persistent objective deficits. Denial for lack of documentation of medical necessity does not align with the record documenting failed conservative care, objective neurologic findings, and the clinician\u2019s contemporaneous imaging recommendation.\n  Citation: chart notes excerpt (case_chart_notes_2026-02-14).\n\nRequested action:\n- Reverse the medical necessity denial for CPT 72148 and authorize the lumbar MRI to appropriately evaluate for compressive pathology and to guide next-step care.",
